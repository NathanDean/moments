# Moments - Full stack photo sharing app

Deployed to Heroku <a href = "https://sheltered-reef-45999.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

Moments is a CRUD photo sharing app using that allows users to create an account and sign in, then create, edit, delete, like and comment on posts.

The app is built with React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB/Mongoose, and uses Redux for state management, React Router for Navigation, Axios for API requests and Material UI for styling.  It can handle authentication and authorisation via email or Google Identity Services, making use of packages such as jsonwebtoken and bcrypt.

This project has helped me to better understand how data flows both within Redux and between the front-end, back-end and database, as well as giving me the chance to develop my JavaScript and React skills by implementing features such as routing, authentication/authorisation and CSS-in-JS within a full stack app.
