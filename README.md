## What 

A full-stack social media site built with React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.  It is a CRUD app, which allows users to create a profile, sign in, then create, edit, like, comment on and delete posts. 

## Why 

After completing courses covering React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB, I wanted to create a full stack MERN app that would allow me to combine my skills with these technologies in one place.  After researching some potential projects, I decided that building a social media app would be a good opportunity to implement full CRUD functionality, as well as being relevant to modern trends in web development. 

## How 

The app is built with React on the front-end, and uses Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and Material UI for styling.  It can handle authentication and authorisation via email or Google Identity Services, making use of the jsonwebtoken and bcrypt packages. 

## What I learnt 

When I began the project I only knew the basics of Redux, so I spent some time studying the underlying concepts before applying them to the project.  By doing this, I came to have a far better understanding of the principles of Redux, the ways that the front-end, back-end and database interact, and how data flows between each. 

Similarly, this was my first time implementing authentication and authorisation in an app.  I began by learning about concepts such as hashing and salting, as well as the bcrypt password hashing function and Google OAuth, before applying them to add sign up and login functionality to the site.  I found doing this very satisfying, and I’m excited to explore the explore how authenticating and authorising users will allow me to build bigger and more complex projects in future.
